# 1. Introduction

Healthy food has become a trending topic in the past few years. People are paying more attention to what they eat, and how they eat. Several consumers are changing their habits from animal derived goods to plant-based goods, and the interest has increased significantly in the United Kingdom.

The Vegan Society [[1]](https://www.vegansociety.com/news/media/statistics#vegandietintheuk) has a collection of statistics with its sources that can present the growing potential of this market. Some interesting observations are extracted and presented here:
> The UK's purchase and consumption rates of vegan: milk, meat, butter/margarine, cheese, ready meals/food to go and seafood are the highest in Europe. [[2]](https://proveg.com/what-we-do/corporate-engagement/proveg-consumer-survey-report-download/)
>
> In 2018, the UK launched more vegan products than any nation. [[3]](https://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/veganuary-uk-overtakes-germany-as-worlds-leader-for-vegan-food-launches)
>
> Between November 2019 and November 2020, vegan food orders via Deliveroo shot up 115%. [[4]](https://www.casualdiningmagazine.co.uk/news/2020-10-29-vegan-orders-surge-more-than-100-in-12-months)
>
> Demand for meat-free food in the UK increased by 987% in 2017 and going vegan was predicted to be the biggest food trend in 2018. [[5]](https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/2017-ridiculous-987-increase-demand-meat-free-options/)

The Google Trends [[6]](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=%2Fm%2F07_hy) on veganism puts the UK as the fourth region with more interest in the subject, and shows the increase in search of veganism consistently rising since 2013.

Considering these findings, a new business dedicated to vegan products seems a promising idea. There is possibility for profit together with a social and environmental impact on the society, values that are becoming more and more important for customers when deciding over what they are consuming. Also, there is still low competition in the segment, which buys time for the businees to stablish itself as pioneer and retain loyal customers.

This study will evaluate where to open a new vegan restaurant in London, capital of England and the UK. The goal is to retrieve where there is a lack of options of vegan/vegetarian restaurants, but also have available clientele (for example, regions with lots of restaurants or bars guarantee exposition).

Hopefully this report will not only reach people who intend to open a new profitable, sustainable and environmental-friendly business, but also share some light on the importance of evaluating our eating habits and at least reduce the consumption of animal derived products.
