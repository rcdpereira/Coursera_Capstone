# Introduction

Anyone who needs to commute (almost all of us) worries about being involved in an accident. Even worse, when dropping your children at school you definitely don't want to be in an accident with them - the risk is too high to measure. Campaigns for improving traffic quality and safety can be found anywhere in the world, mostly conducted by governments.

This analysis will evaluate a dataset from road accidents in the UK, pulling data from 2005 to 2016, aiming to find important correlations to predict road accidents severity. The result model can be used to determine which shall be the focus of the government campaigns for safer traffic conditions.
