# Coursera_Capstone
This project will be used to share the Coursera Capstone to get a Data Science Professional Certificate.

The project consists of a data analysis over road accidents in the UK, in an effort to predict which conditions influence the severity of the accidents. The objective is to direct government campaigns for traffic safety.

This repository holds the Jupyter Notebook with detailed information about how the analysis was conducted. The .csv files were not included, but a link referencing the source is available in the notebook.

Also, a full report can be found at [Final Report](https://rcdpereira.github.io/Coursera_Capstone). This page was created with the intention to showcase the final report and make it available for the public.

If you have any comments, critics or suggestions, please contact me! Hope you enjoy the contents of the work.
