# Coursera_Capstone
This project will be used to share the Coursera Capstone to receive a Data Science Professional Certificate.

A Jupyter Notebook holds the coding related to the analysis, with explanations on the step by step. Also, a full report can be found at [Final Report](https://rcdpereira.github.io/Coursera_Capstone). This page was created with the intention to showcase the final report and make it available for the public.

If you have any comments, critics or suggestions, please contact me!
Hope you enjoy the contents of the work.
