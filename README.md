# Coursera_Capstone
This project will be used to share the Coursera Capstone to receive a Data Science Professional Certificate.

A [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/rcdpereira/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/Data_Analysis_Vegan_Restaurants_UK.ipynb) holds the coding related to the analysis, with explanations on the step by step. Also, a full report can be found at [Final Report](https://github.com/rcdpereira/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/Final%20Report%20-%20Opening%20a%20Vegan%20Restaurant%20in%20London.pdf), and a resumed presentation [here](https://github.com/rcdpereira/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/Presentation_Opening%20a%20Vegan%20Restaurant%20in%20London.pdf).

This page was created with the intention to showcase the final report and make it available for the public.
